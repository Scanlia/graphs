# Medical Research Graphs

This repository contains Python scripts for generating various graphs and visualizations used in medical research. The graphs are designed to analyze and present data related to plaque features, hazard ratios, and other metrics in a clear and visually appealing manner.

## Contents

### Files
1. **`plaque_graph.py`**
   - Generates a bar chart comparing plaque volumes and percentages for men and women.
   - Saves the output as `plaque_graph.png`.

2. **`ai-qct-forest-plots.py`**
   - Creates a forest plot visualizing hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) for different plaque features by sex.
   - Saves the output as `forest_plot.png`.

3. **`.gitignore`**
   - Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as Python cache files, virtual environments, and build artifacts.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, you need the following Python libraries installed:
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-research-graphs.git
   cd medical-research-graphs
   ```

2. Run the desired script:
   - For the plaque graph:
     ```bash
     python plaque_graph.py
     ```
     This will generate a bar chart and save it as `plaque_graph.png`.

   - For the forest plot:
     ```bash
     python ai-qct-forest-plots.py
     ```
     This will generate a forest plot and save it as `forest_plot.png`.

3. View the generated graphs:
   - Open the PNG files (`plaque_graph.png` or `forest_plot.png`) in your preferred image viewer.

## Graph Details

### Plaque Graph (`plaque_graph.py`)
- **Purpose**: Compares plaque volumes (in mmÂ³) and percentages (%) between men and women.
- **Features**:
  - Dual y-axes for volumes and percentages.
  - Bar labels for precise values.
  - Combined legend for clarity.

### Forest Plot (`ai-qct-forest-plots.py`)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) for plaque features by sex.
- **Features**:
  - Error bars for CI.
  - Custom y-axis positions for grouped features.
  - HR values displayed as text next to the points.

## Customization

You can modify the scripts to:
- Adjust font sizes, colors, or figure dimensions.
- Add or update data for new analyses.
- Save the graphs in different formats (e.g., PDF, SVG).
